# SI508-FinalProject

Steps to run this program:

STEP 1 - Keys

Keys needed to be obtained:
1. The Movie Database API
2. Taste Dive API
These keys should be inputted in the FP_secrets.py file.

STEP 2 - Flask

Download all the files in the repository.
Run python FP_Flask.py runserver in the terminal.
All other files and libraries should already be imported.

STEP 3 - Program

1. This is a movie recommendation program. After you run FP_Flask.py, a main page asking you to input two movies should appear on your localhost:5000
2. Input two movies and click Submit. If you input a string that doesn't make sense or if a movie doesn't exist in the database, an error message will appear at the top of the main page.
3. After two successful movies are inputted, the program will produce a list containing movies with the similar name that you inputted. Choose two movies that you actually want and click Submit. If you don't choose anything and then click Submit, the default movies are the last movies in the two lists.
4. Then the program will bring you to the next page where it lists at most 10 recommended movies based on the two movies you chose.
ENJOY!
